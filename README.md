# CleanCodeCrawler
The repo for the assignment 1 for clean code, implementing a web crawler
The way to use the crawler is via the user class, where it extracts the arguments from the command line in the following order:

*StartUrl* *depth* *domain*

Example input of crawler: 

https://www.iana.org/help/example-domains 1 iana.org

To properly use the Crawler please also change the filepath in the crawler class, which is where the report is saved to. This is done in line 17 of the crawler class. 

This project was done in collaboration between the following students of Group 3: 

Thomas Wobak

Maximillian Sellner
